    "An **electromagnetic (EM) shower** is a cascade of particles, including photons, electrons, and positrons, forms when a high-energy electron or photon interacts with dense material and produces a chain of secondary particles. Photons convert into electron–positron pairs, and these charged particles in turn emit bremsstrahlung photons, repeating the process as the shower multiplies and spreads. The cascade continues until particle energies fall below a critical value, where ionization dominates and the shower dies out. In an electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal), this process is harnessed to measure particle energies: alternating layers of absorber and active material contain and sample the shower, converting the deposited energy into measurable signals. The total signal provides a precise estimate of the incident electron or photon’s energy and impact position, making EM calorimetry a key technique in modern high-energy physics experiments.\n",
