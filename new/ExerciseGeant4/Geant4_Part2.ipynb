    "- The hadronic interaction length is much larger than the radiation length of photons and electrons.\n",
    "- Hadronic showers consist to about a third of neutral pions that decay into two photons.\n",

    "- **Sampling calorimeter** <br>\n",
    "    Sampling calorimeters have a layered structure with alternating layers of absorber (passive) and detector (active) material.\n",
    "    On the one hand, the design and material choice are flexible and optimisable to a specific task or financial budget.\n",
    "    On the other hand, some of the energy is deposited in the absorber which limits the energy resolution.\n",
    "- **Homogenous calorimeter** <br>\n",
    "    Here, one material is used simultaneously as an absorber and active material.\n",
    "    Consequently, all the energy is deposited in the detector which allows for an optimal energy resolution.\n",
    "    Also, the choice of the material can be specialised to the task, e.g. CsI has a very low light yield but allows for fast readout; CsI(Tl) has high light yield but slow readout. \n",
    "    However, the materials capable of this task (mostly scintillator crystals) are custom made which makes them often very expensive and very heavy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The following exercises will focus on a sampling calorimeter structure with lead absorbers and liquid argon as active material.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect of calorimeters is the readout of the detector which determines the measured energy of the particle.\n",
    "The total number of particles in an electromagnetic shower is proportional to the initial energy of the particle.\n",
    "One very common use case in high-energy particle experiments is the use of scintillation materials.\n",
    "In this case, the electromagnetic shower leads to the production of photons in the visible spectrum which can be measured by photo multipliers, photo diodes, etc.\n",
    "For example, the voltage measured at a silicon photomultiplier is proportional to the number of incoming photons which in turn is proportional to the initial energy.\n",
    "The following exercises will discuss a closely related measurement principle: The count of charged particles in the active material."
